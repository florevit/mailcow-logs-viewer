## [1.4.3] - 2026-01-01

### Changed

#### Configuration
- **Automatic Domain Detection**: Removed `MAILCOW_LOCAL_DOMAINS` environment variable requirement
  - Active domains are now automatically fetched from Mailcow API (`/api/v1/get/domain/all`)
  - Only active domains are used
  - Domains are cached on application startup
  - No manual domain configuration needed anymore

#### UI Improvements

  - Changed from comma-separated list to grid layout (columns)
  - Scrollable container for many domains

#### Code Quality
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary comments from codebase
  - Removed verbose comments that don't add value
  - Cleaned up phase markers and redundant inline comments
  - Improved code readability

### Fixed

#### Security Tab
- **Timestamp Formatting**: Fixed timestamp display in Security tab to match Messages page format
  - All timestamps now properly formatted with UTC timezone ('Z' suffix)
  - Consistent date/time display across all tabs
- **Banned Filter**: Fixed filter not working correctly for "Banning" messages
  - Now correctly identifies "Banning" (present tense) messages as banned actions
  - Uses priority field ("crit") to determine ban status when message parsing is ambiguous
  - Added support for CIDR notation in ban messages (e.g., "Banning 3.134.148.0/24")
- **View Consistency**: Removed old table view that was sometimes displayed
  - Only card-based view is now used consistently
  - Smart refresh now uses same rendering function as initial load
- **Duplicate Log Prevention**: Fixed duplicate security events appearing in Security tab
  - Added deduplication logic based on message + time + priority combination
  - Frontend filters duplicates before display (handles legacy data)
  - Backend import now checks database for existing logs with same message + time + priority before inserting
  - Prevents duplicate entries from being stored in database during import

#### Import Status
- **Last Fetch Run Time**: Added tracking of when imports run (not just when data is imported)
  - Status page now shows "Last Fetch Run" (when import job ran) separate from "Last Import" (when data was actually imported)
  - Resolves confusion when imports run but no new logs are available
  - All three log types (Postfix, Rspamd, Netfilter) now track fetch run times

#### Netfilter Logging
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed debug logs for Netfilter import process
  - Logs show when fetch starts, how many logs received, how many imported, and how many skipped as duplicates
  - Better error tracking for troubleshooting import delays
- **Import Deduplication**: Improved duplicate detection during Netfilter log import
  - Now checks database for existing logs with same message + time + priority before inserting
  - Uses combination of message + time + priority as unique identifier (instead of time + IP + message)
  - Prevents duplicate entries from being stored in database

### Added

#### Version Management
- **VERSION File**: Version number now managed in single `VERSION` file instead of hardcoded in multiple places
  - Supports both Docker and development environments

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Rspamd-Postfix Correlation**
  - Postfix logs now visible in message details
  - Rspamd logs now correctly find and join Postfix correlations
  - Fixed: Rspamd doesn't have Queue-ID, must search Postfix to find it

### Changed
- `correlate_rspamd_log()` - Complete rewrite
  - Now searches Postfix logs to find Queue-ID
  - Method 1: Search by message-id → get Queue-ID from Postfix
  - Method 2: Search by sender+recipient+time → get Queue-ID from Postfix
  - Then attaches to correlation with that Queue-ID

### Technical
- Rspamd logs now actively query Postfix logs table
- Queue-ID extracted from matching Postfix log
- Correlation found/created with that Queue-ID
- Ensures Rspamd and Postfix logs are properly linked

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Correlation Logic Completely Rewritten**
  - Queue-ID is now the PRIMARY correlation key (not secondary!)
  - Message-ID moved to fallback (only used if no Queue-ID)
  - Fixes cases where messages still appeared as duplicates even after v1.1.0
  - Resolves issue where message-id log line and delivery log lines created separate correlations

### Changed
- `correlate_postfix_log()` - Complete rewrite of priority logic
- Queue-ID now checked FIRST and returns immediately if found
- Message-ID and sender+recipient+time are now pure fallbacks

### Technical
- Old: Message-ID → Queue-ID → fallback
- New: Queue-ID → Message-ID (fallback) → sender+recipient+time (fallback)
- Reason: Queue-ID is the definitive Postfix identifier for a message

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Message Entries**: Single emails no longer appear multiple times in Messages view
  - Issue occurred when emails were sent to multiple recipients
  - Each Postfix delivery log was creating a separate correlation
  - Now all deliveries with same Queue-ID correctly attach to single correlation

### Added
- Automatic database migration system
- `migrations.py` module for database maintenance tasks
- Automatic duplicate correlation cleanup on startup
- Migration runs seamlessly without user intervention

### Changed
- Improved Queue-ID correlation logic in `correlate_postfix_log()`
- When Queue-ID exists but no correlation found, immediately creates new correlation with that Queue-ID
- Prevents fallback to methods that could create duplicates
- All documentation now in English only

### Performance
- Migration adds <5 seconds to startup time (one-time per container lifecycle)
- Improved query performance due to fewer duplicate records
- No ongoing performance penalty
