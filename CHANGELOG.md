## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

#### UI Enhancements
- **Result Count Display**: Messages, Security, and Queue pages now show total result count in header (e.g., "All Messages (1,234 results)")
- **Delivery Error Summary**: Logs tab now displays prominent error box at top when delivery fails, extracting error reason from "said:" pattern
- **Security Tab Indicator**: Green/red dot indicator showing if there are security events in the last 24 hours
- **Multiple Recipients Display**: Messages with multiple recipients now show all recipients in Overview and Logs tabs
- **Expired Correlations Counter**: Status page shows count of expired (incomplete) correlations

#### New Features
- **Messages CSV Export**: Added missing `/api/export/messages/csv` endpoint with full filtering support
- **Separate Fetch Parameters**: New ENV variables for granular control:
  - `FETCH_COUNT_POSTFIX` (default: 500)
  - `FETCH_COUNT_RSPAMD` (default: 500)
  - `FETCH_COUNT_NETFILTER` (default: 500)
- **Correlation Expiration System**: Correlations older than `MAX_CORRELATION_AGE_MINUTES` marked as "expired" instead of deleted
- **IP/User Search**: Messages page now supports filtering by IP address and authenticated user

#### Backend Improvements
- **Three-Layer Blacklist Protection**: Blacklist filtering at API fetch, database insert, and display levels
- **Separate Correlation Expiration Job**: Dedicated background job for marking old incomplete correlations
- **Startup Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of blacklisted entries on container start

### Changed

#### UI Reorganization
- **Postfix Tab → Logs Tab**: Renamed for clarity
- **Security Page Overhaul**: Changed from table layout to card-based UI with better visual hierarchy
- **Settings → Status Migration**: Moved system info, import status, and background jobs to Status page
- **Dashboard Quick Search**: Simplified to single search field (removed separate log type selector)
- **Dashboard Statistics**: Now uses MessageCorrelation table for accurate message counts

#### Backend Changes
- **Postfix Log Deduplication**: Main list now groups by Queue-ID, showing one row per message
- **Rspamd Symbol Options**: Now displays symbol options (e.g., RCVD_COUNT shows actual count)
- **Correlation Expiration Logic**: Changed from deletion to "expired" status marking

### Fixed

#### Critical Fixes
- **UniqueViolation Race Condition**: Fixed database race condition when multiple correlations created simultaneously
- **BCC Blacklist Problem**: Fixed issue where BCC copies bypassed blacklist filtering
- **Queue ID Blacklist Filtering**: Now properly filters queue entries by blacklisted sender/recipient
- **Messages Export**: Fixed empty CSV export (endpoint was missing)

#### UI Fixes
- **Timezone Errors**: All timestamps now properly formatted with UTC indicator
- **Dashboard Timestamp Formatting**: Fixed incorrect date display in recent activity
- **Settings Page Timestamps**: Fixed timestamp display in import status section
- **JavaScript Syntax Errors**: Fixed various JS errors that broke page functionality
- **Emoji Cleanup**: Removed emoji characters that caused encoding issues in logs

#### Data Accuracy
- **Incomplete Correlation Cleanup**: Fixed correlations stuck in incomplete state
- **Postfix Logs Display**: Fixed cases where Postfix logs weren't showing in message details
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Enhanced deduplication in both correlation and display layers

### Technical

#### New Configuration Options
```env
# Separate fetch counts per log type
FETCH_COUNT_POSTFIX=500
FETCH_COUNT_RSPAMD=500
FETCH_COUNT_NETFILTER=500

# Correlation expiration (minutes)
MAX_CORRELATION_AGE_MINUTES=10

# Correlation check interval (seconds)
CORRELATION_CHECK_INTERVAL=120
```

#### Database Changes
- Added `is_expired` field to MessageCorrelation model
- Added indexes for IP and user queries on RspamdLog

#### API Changes
- `GET /api/export/messages/csv` - New endpoint for messages export
- `GET /api/messages` - Added `ip` and `user` query parameters
- `GET /api/stats/dashboard` - Now returns accurate counts from correlations

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Rspamd-Postfix Correlation**
  - Postfix logs now visible in message details
  - Rspamd logs now correctly find and join Postfix correlations
  - Fixed: Rspamd doesn't have Queue-ID, must search Postfix to find it

### Changed
- `correlate_rspamd_log()` - Complete rewrite
  - Now searches Postfix logs to find Queue-ID
  - Method 1: Search by message-id → get Queue-ID from Postfix
  - Method 2: Search by sender+recipient+time → get Queue-ID from Postfix
  - Then attaches to correlation with that Queue-ID

### Technical
- Rspamd logs now actively query Postfix logs table
- Queue-ID extracted from matching Postfix log
- Correlation found/created with that Queue-ID
- Ensures Rspamd and Postfix logs are properly linked

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Correlation Logic Completely Rewritten**
  - Queue-ID is now the PRIMARY correlation key (not secondary!)
  - Message-ID moved to fallback (only used if no Queue-ID)
  - Fixes cases where messages still appeared as duplicates even after v1.1.0
  - Resolves issue where message-id log line and delivery log lines created separate correlations

### Changed
- `correlate_postfix_log()` - Complete rewrite of priority logic
- Queue-ID now checked FIRST and returns immediately if found
- Message-ID and sender+recipient+time are now pure fallbacks

### Technical
- Old: Message-ID → Queue-ID → fallback
- New: Queue-ID → Message-ID (fallback) → sender+recipient+time (fallback)
- Reason: Queue-ID is the definitive Postfix identifier for a message

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Message Entries**: Single emails no longer appear multiple times in Messages view
  - Issue occurred when emails were sent to multiple recipients
  - Each Postfix delivery log was creating a separate correlation
  - Now all deliveries with same Queue-ID correctly attach to single correlation

### Added
- Automatic database migration system
- `migrations.py` module for database maintenance tasks
- Automatic duplicate correlation cleanup on startup
- Migration runs seamlessly without user intervention

### Changed
- Improved Queue-ID correlation logic in `correlate_postfix_log()`
- When Queue-ID exists but no correlation found, immediately creates new correlation with that Queue-ID
- Prevents fallback to methods that could create duplicates
- All documentation now in English only

### Performance
- Migration adds <5 seconds to startup time (one-time per container lifecycle)
- Improved query performance due to fewer duplicate records
- No ongoing performance penalty
